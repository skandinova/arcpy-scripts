# LidarToTopo Tool
- I made this tool to automate a process at work in which we made contours for maps from lidar exported as shapefiles from PLS-CADD project files.
- It utilizes LAStools, downloadable [here](https://rapidlasso.de/downloads/), to find the point spacing to help delineate the TIN to avoid outside clutter in the end result.
- The code is [LidarToTopo.py](https://github.com/skandinova/arcpy-scripts/blob/main/LidarToTopo/LidarToTopo.py) and the rest is the environment that the script tool utilizes.
